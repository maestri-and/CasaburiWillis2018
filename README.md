## Overview of the package

The R code scripts replicate five key exhibits published by Casaburi &amp; Willis in "Time versus State in Insurance: Experimental Evidence from Contract Farming in Kenya" (AER, 2018).

All data was made publicly available by the authors. The original code, written in STATA, along with the data, can be found in the folder 'original_package/do' within this remote repository. Access to the published original package can be accessed [here](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20171526) with the appropriate credentials.

## Description of key folders
- `./data`: contains the three datasets used for this project, including `data_cashexp.dta`, `data_mainexp.dta` and `data_timeexp.dta`
- `./original_package/do`: contains the original STATA code files
- `./output`: folder where all outputs produced by the R code scripts are saved; figures are stored in jpg format, while tables are saved in LaTeX file formats.
- `./src`: contains the three key R script files replicating the five chosen exhibits. 
  - `a_analysis_main_experiment.R` replicates Exhibit 1 (Table 2 + Figure 3), Exhibit 2 (Table 3), Exhibit 3 (Table 6)
  - `b_analysis_main_experiment.R` replicates Exhibit 4 (Table 4 + Figure 4)
  - `c_analysis_main_experiment.R` replicates Exhibit 5 (Table 5 + Figure 5)

## Instructions for Replication
The package is structured as as R Project integrated with **renv**, to ensure reproducibility.
To reproduce the main exhibits of Casaburi & Willis, 2018, the user should perform the following steps:
- Download or clone the repository on your local machine
- Using VSCode (with appropriate extensions) or RStudio, open the Rproject file contained in the repository (in RStudio, `File -> Open project`).
- Run the master script `run.R` located in the main folder of the package. The master script will recall the subscripts contained in "src" used to instantiate the environment and reproduce the results of the main experiment, the cash experiment and the time experiment. While instantiating the environment, user may be asked to confirm the installation of required packages by typing "Y" in the console.

In case of difficulties with the renv setup, the user can also run the scripts individually, ensuring to have installed the needed packages beforehand. 

The replication scripts are expected to run for less than two minutes on a standard 2025 machine (last tested on Windows 11 machine equipped with RStudio 2024.12.0+467 "Kousa Dogwood" Release and R 4.2.2).
